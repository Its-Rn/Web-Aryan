					<p style="font-family:verdana;">And The thought kept recurring in my mind, making me feel unwell. While I initially thought the feeling would pass, it persisted and I began overthinking about you.But No my heart felt like it was filling up with something heavy and I felt jealous,and I couldn't shake the thought, and it was making me feel sick.but Why i didn't know the Answer of that's Question.</p>
					<p style="font-family:verdana;">then i think i will text you on whatsapp and tell you how today I was feel like that, but I stopped myself because I realise i was getting emotional. at that time you was give reply of that message. even i don't know how to react on that time. an you getting angry and say we will talk later. that's also getting me confused and.</p>
					<p style="font-family:verdana;">I waited for you to text back but never heard from you.i just checking message and i didn't understand what happened with mine. an that time that's unknown feeling at the peak level.I kept checking my phone for a message from youâ€”like, at least 400-500 times. I even caught myself doing it at Night 2 Am Looking back, I can't believe I was acting like that. </p>

					<b><p style="font-family:verdana;"> <h4 style="color:red;"> Honestly, I have no idea why I felt that way or what brought it on. All I know is that I'll never forget how intense it was,</h4></p></b>
